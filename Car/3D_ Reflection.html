  <h1> Matchbox Car Replication - 3D Printing </h1>
  <p> During the 3D car replication project, we were instructed to choose a
         car and recreate it by first measuring and drawing out the car, and
         then uploading that design into OnShape. Lastly, we formatted our file accordingly for the 3D printer. </i></p>
  <h2>The Steps Were as Follows: </h2>

  <h3> Guidelines:</h3>
  <p> The initial guidelines for this project were to design a car in a 1:1 replication
      with a size accuracy of +/- 1%. We then had to export that design as an STL, and orient
      our design in Cura for 3D printing. After printing our car, we needed to compare it to
      the original car and make note of the differences between the two. </p>

  <h3> Design:</h3>
  <p>
      After choosing our car, we measured it using a caliper and recorded those measurements on graph paper.
      We then drew our car to scale in three different profiles. We also drew a 3D version
      of the car that compiled all of the profiles that we drew. Once complete, we scanned our drawing and uploaded
      each profile into OnShape. Using our drawing as a guide, we traced our intial lines and then removed all negative space
      using the extrude tool. With the body of our car complete, we then added more detail by using the fillet tool,
      and then also added wheels. Before moving on to cura, we constructed a CAD drawing in order to compare our car in OnShape
      to the original toy car. Lastly, we exported our design as an STL file and imported it into cura. In cura, we
      positioned our 3D model on the build plate in order to minimize support material, and set the nozzel to 0.6 mm. We then
      exported the file as a GCODE file, chose a color, and printed our car.
  </p>

    <h3> Challenges and Solutions: </h3>
    <p>
      During my design process, there were a few setbacks that occurred. One of these setbacks was that when I traced my drawing
      in OnShape, I did not connect the lines to the edge of the box, so when I used the extrude tool, I ended up cutting out
      large portions of the side of my car. In order to fix this, I went back into my initial sketch layer and traced the car
      so that the edges of the car were connected to the box. When I extruded the negative space for the second time, I found
      that I was still cutting into the side of my car, but I decided to keep these small indents as an added design. Another setback
      that ocurred was that my wheels were not to scale and were too large. In order to fix this, I went back into the sketch layer
      and scaled down the wheels, allowing them to match the fit of the rest of the car.
